**Enumeration:**

I started with quick rustscan, which gave me 3 open ports :

    sudo rustscan -a 10.10.11.194 -- -sC -sV -T4 -vv -oN soccer_nmap
    
    Open 10.10.11.194:22 --> OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
    Open 10.10.11.194:80  --> nginx 1.18.0
    Open 10.10.11.194:9091  --> xmltec-xmlmail?

Found a domain to resolve in the port scan results & added it to the hosts list, i.e. "http://soccer.htb"

Went to the website & found a regular page with very limited options :

Next, I started the I scanned the website using gobuster for the subdomains & found only 1 subdomain in the result :

      gobuster dir -u http://soccer.htb -t 20 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -o soccer -b 404,403 -k
      
      /tiny                 (Status: 301) [Size: 178] [--> http://soccer.htb/tiny/]

I quickly checked the website & found a login panel in it, URL redirected me to another URL, i.e. "http://soccer.htb/tiny/tinyfilemanager.php"

This looks like a some kind of file manager. I scanned this subdomain with the gobuster & found another subdomain :

      /uploads              (Status: 301) [Size: 178] [--> http://soccer.htb/tiny/uploads/]

I tried to access it but I need to login before accessing it as it showed 403 error ðŸ˜•

I then moved back to the '/tiny' login page & checked for the source code & found that it's running on version 2.4.3

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/209574936-eb3044f6-ea5c-4656-bcaa-60baefeda7ea.png)

I checked for the exploits of 'tiny file manager 2.4' on google & found many refrences. Such as :

      Exploit DB : https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50828 (Tiny File Manager RCE <= 2.4.6)
      GitHub : https://github.com/febinrev/tinyfilemanager-2.4.3-exploit (Path traversal)
      
But both the exploit needs an authenticated user for the successfull exploit. So, I tried the different kind of SQL injection to check whether it's vulnerable to SQLi but no luck. ðŸ˜•

**Initial access :**

Then I tried the default credentials for the file manager, i.e. 'admin' : 'admin@123' & it's worked.ðŸ™‚

When logged in found a file/website manager kind of page.

And now I can access the upload section as well.

I stucked at this point as the exploit POC is not working as expected & it seems like I can't upload the data to the regular path.

I tried other possible way to exploit path traversal vulnerability & LFI but no luck in all of them. I have to figure out the correct path to upload the file.
After searching for approx 2 hours I landed onto this page, where I observed that I can upload/write my files : http://soccer.htb/tiny/tinyfilemanager.php?p=tiny%2Fuploads&upload

I uploaded a PHP reverse shell & started listening on my kali machine, browsed on my uploaded file & catched the reverse shell.(pwn3d!ðŸ™‚)

The shell is not stable so first thing I did is stablized the shell, using these coomands :

      python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
      export TERM=xterm
      stty raw -echo; fg
      
So, currently I am running as 'www-data' & there is another user directory present, i.e. 'player'. Player directory is having the user flag but I don't have access to it.
