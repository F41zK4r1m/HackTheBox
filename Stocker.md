#### Rustscan

Started with a quick Rustscan :
    
    sudo rustscan -a 10.10.11.196 -- -sC -sV -T4 -vv -oN stock_nmap

After scan I only found 2 open ports, i.e. :

    22 - open  ssh  syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
    80 - open  http syn-ack ttl 63 nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu)

Also, found a re-direction towards the domain : http://stocker.htb, added this redirection to the /etc/hosts file.

After adding browsed through the website & a regular website which is still under developement.

Ran GoBuster for the subdomain enumeration but didn't found anything helpful.

Then moved ahead to the vhost enumeration using GoBuster but didn't got any of the result as well.ðŸ˜•

After failed to find any intitial access vector in the website & the subdomain enumeration I thought of finally giving a try with "FFUF" for vhsot enumeration & subdomain enumeration & I finally got a new vhost from the scanning result.

        dev.stocker.htb

 Added the newly found domain in the /etc/hosts config file & opened the link in the browser & found a login page on the screen.

Also, ran a sub-domain enumeration again on this new website but didn't found any useful subdomain.

In this login page I tried different SQLi payloads but none of them worked, then I moved on to try the NoSQL payloads from the hactrickz website.
Tried this json payload & got the 200 response :

        {"username": {"$ne": null}, "password": {"$ne": null} }
        
Also, the Content-Type needs to be changed to **Content-Type: application/json** because we are using the json syntax.

Followed the re-direction & landed onto this website : "dev.stocker.htb/stock"

When checked the source code of the page found that there is an api request which is performing the POST request with the order id.

I then performed some manual enumeration & orderd something on the website & intercepted the requests with Burp.
I observed from the proxy requests that the order ID which is appeared in the burp proxy is also visible in the final URL of the PDF result.

Which means that the PDF is working dynamically, so I took some help from the hint & found an exploit related to [Dynamic PDF](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/xss-cross-site-scripting/server-side-xss-dynamic-pd).
