  ## Enumeration:

I started with performing the quick rustscan on the target to check all open ports & running services. After the completion of the scan I found 2 open ports:

  - 22 -> OpenSSH 8.4p1 Debian 5+deb11u1 (protocol 2.0)
  - 80 -> nginx 1.18.0

```
In the port 80, I observed it's running the nginx server with version 1.18.0 & there is a domain present on that server: "pilgrimage.htb". Along with that I also observed './git' folder running on the host.
I added the domain to my hosts file & browsed through it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Web Enumeration:

I then performed subdomain & DNS host enumeration on the target host, using GoBuster & FFUF.

I observed 3 sub-directories in the results:

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/HackTheBox/assets/87700008/70ef7b65-79d7-4306-a4f5-386da3cddcbd)

Didn't found anything in the DNS host enumeration. Also, when tried to access those 3 directories but got 403 error which looks like I need to authenticate before accessing the directories.

Then I checked the website & found it's providig tool to compress image files.

After going through all the results I move onto the GIT part & tried to accessed it but it seems like I can't access "http://pilgrimage.htb/.git/" directly. So, I used a tool called "git-dumper" to dump the GIT repo into my local system.

```bash
git-dumper http://pilgrimage.htb/.git/ git
```

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### GIT enumeration:

After the dump I started with the GIT enumeration:

- Found just one 'master' branch:

- In GIT logs I found a user with the commit ID: **e1a40beebc7035212efdcb15476f9c994e3634a7**, user: emily <emily@pilgrimage.htb>

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/HackTheBox/assets/87700008/4c4dbc9d-7d28-43c2-8329-43c04aba526f)

- I found a PHP library "BULLETPROOF", which handles secure image uploads.

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/HackTheBox/assets/87700008/9dd2cf3c-27ae-41f3-b9fc-71569613e823)

- In the dumped GIT folder I found a linux executable file name: "magic", which looks like performing the operation of image shrink. It's using "ImageMagick 7.1.0-49", which is vulnerable to arbitrary file read.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Initial access:

To exploit the ImageMagic I downloaded a POC from this [Github repo](https://github.com/Sybil-Scan/imagemagick-lfi-poc) & followed the process.

First I generated a malicious PNG file to read /etc/passwd content:

```python3
python3 generate.py -f "/etc/passwd" -o exploit.png
```

Then uploaded the file to website for shrinking & download the result PNG file to my attack box.

Using the "Exiftool" I extracted the RAW content of the PNG file:

Decoded this raw profile in the GitHub & got the result of '/etc/passwd' file content:

Now, as I confirmed that the POC is working, I moved on to fetch more relevant information & observed in the dashboard.php file that there is a SQL database configured which is verifying the user access:

I created a PNG image to fetch the data from DB "/var/db/pilgrimage" & uploaded it, got the result image & after decoding the image I found a password which belongs to **emily**.

Used the grabbed password & tried to logged in via SSH. Using the password I successfully logged into the Emily profile & grabbed the user flag.(pwn3d!ðŸ™‚)
